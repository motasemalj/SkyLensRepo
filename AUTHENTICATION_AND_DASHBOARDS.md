## üöÄ Getting Started

### Database Migration

First, you need to apply the database schema changes:

```bash
cd backend

# If you have a DATABASE_URL set up, run:
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Or for development:
npx prisma migrate dev

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

### Environment Variables

Make sure your backend has these environment variables set:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
PORT=4001
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

And your frontend `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:4001"
```

### Starting the Application

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## üìù Database Schema

The updated schema includes:

```prisma
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  email     String   @unique
  password  String
  name      String?
  isAdmin   Boolean  @default(false)
  orders    Order[]
}

model Order {
  id          String      @id @default(uuid())
  user        User        @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId      String
  service     ServiceType  // NEW FIELD
  location    String
  latitude    Float?
  longitude   Float?
  package     Package
  description String
