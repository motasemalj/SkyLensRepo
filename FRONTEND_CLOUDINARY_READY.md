Your entire frontend now loads images from Cloudinary CDN instead of local files!

### Updated Files:
1. ✅ `frontend/src/lib/imageConfig.ts` - Image helper with all Cloudinary paths
2. ✅ `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - Home page uses Cloudinary
3. ✅ `frontend/src/app/services/page.tsx` - Services page uses Cloudinary
4. ✅ `frontend/src/app/about/page.tsx` - About page uses Cloudinary
5. ✅ `frontend/next.config.ts` - Configured to allow Cloudinary domain

## 🚀 Test It Now!

### Step 1: Restart Your Dev Server

```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C if running)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Your Browser

Visit: http://localhost:3000

### Step 3: Open Browser DevTools

Press F12 or Cmd+Option+I (Mac) to open DevTools, then go to the Network tab.

### Step 4: Verify Images Load from Cloudinary

Refresh the page and look for image requests. You should see URLs like:
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/dm2sd9t1n/image/upload/skylens/hero-drone
https://res.cloudinary.com/dm2sd9t1n/image/upload/skylens/skylens-logo
https://res.cloudinary.com/dm2sd9t1n/image/upload/skylens/aerial-photography
```

## 📝 Image Mapping

Here's what each page loads from Cloudinary:

### Home Page (`/`)
- Hero background: `skylens/hero-drone` (was 26.67 MB → now 1.24 MB)
- Logo: `skylens/skylens-logo` (was 0.18 MB → now 0.02 MB)

### Services Page (`/services`)
- RAW Footage: `skylens/aerial-photography`
- Fully Edited: `skylens/services/edited` (was 10.24 MB → now 0.37 MB!)
- 3D Mapping: `skylens/3d-mapping`
- Industrial: `skylens/construction`

### About Page (`/about`)
- Story image: `skylens/optimized/project6`
- Team photo: `skylens/abdelhadi` (was 2.89 MB → now 0.91 MB)

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Environment Variable
Set in `frontend/.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://res.cloudinary.com/dm2sd9t1n/image/upload
```

### 2. Image Helper Function
```tsx
import { getImageUrl, IMAGES } from "@/lib/imageConfig";

// Use in components:
<Image src={getImageUrl(IMAGES.hero)} alt="Hero" />
```

### 3. Automatic Path Construction
```
getImageUrl('/skylens/hero-drone')
↓
https://res.cloudinary.com/dm2sd9t1n/image/upload/skylens/hero-drone
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Images not loading?
1. Check `.env.local` exists in frontend folder
2. Restart dev server after changing .env.local
3. Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Seeing old local images?
1. Make sure you restarted the dev server
2. Check browser Network tab to see actual URLs
3. Verify environment variable is set correctly

### Getting 404 errors?
1. Verify image exists: https://res.cloudinary.com/dm2sd9t1n/image/upload/skylens/hero-drone
