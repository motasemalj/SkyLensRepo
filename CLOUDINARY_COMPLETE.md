5. Redeploy!

### 3. Handle the Large GIF (edited.gif)

**Option A: Use the working 3d-mapping.gif instead**
Update `frontend/src/app/services/page.tsx`:
```tsx
{
  title: "Fully Edited Video",
  description: "Get a professionally edited video...",
  image: "/3d-mapping.gif",  // Change from /edited.gif
  ...
}
```

**Option B: Use static JPG preview**
```tsx
image: "/services/edited.jpg"  // Already uploaded and works!
```

**Option C: Manual upload to Cloudinary**
1. Go to https://console.cloudinary.com/console/media_library
2. Upload edited.gif manually
